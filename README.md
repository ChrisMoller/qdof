# qdof

qdof is a Qt-based utility that, given a camera lens focal length, the required depth-of-field "near" and "far" distances, and 
either a camera model or the CoC characteristics of the camera image sensor, will compute the aperature necessary to yield that 
depth of field.

While qdof is a working package that's been tested in both Android and Linux desktop environments, it's primary purpose was to 
give me a non-trivial project with which to experiment with Qt.
